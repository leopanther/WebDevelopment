                        Giving life to all who live on Earth. <br>
                        Our carelessness and fears <br>
                        Have taken a toll over the years. <br>
                        Her land is parched and scorched <br>
                        As man continues to light the torch. <br>
                        We continue a want of speed and ease, <br>
                        All while our pesticides kill off our bees. <br>
                        It's time to wake up and see Mother Earth's pain. <br>
                        Humanity's selfishness is becoming insane. <br>
                        Soon her cries will turn to gloom, <br>
                        And man will cause its own doom. <br>     </p>
